# Zeta-Function-Project

This project was an attempt to implement a new formulation for the Riemann Zeta function in C.

This new formulation, discovered by [Ghaith Hiary](https://people.math.osu.edu/hiary.1/) in his paper "[An Alternative to Riemann-Siegel Type Formulas](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0317)," and this project was advised by Prof Hiary.
